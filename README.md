# Enhance-System-Performance
our center own the core system of government tenders, and for vendors is the only way to apply on RFPs which published by government agencies. The problem is users (vendors) is facing system performance issue when trying to login to Tender page, loading huge files and documents related to all published tenders.
We aim to use data science in addressing the business problem by classifying historical vendor data and address all published tenders and do the necessary matching to view only match tenders in order to minimize the number of files and enhance system performance (generate interesting list).
